## Installation
Clone the repository and run "npm install" from an integrated terminal to install dependencies.   Then initialize the database by running "sql -u root -p" from the db directory, input password, and run the following command to create the database: "source schema.sql".  To seed the database, from the root directory run the following command: "npm run seed".

## Usage
From the root directory, run "npm start" to initialize the server. You can then use an interface such as  Insomnia to test  GET,  POST, PUT and DELETE commands to up date the database as needed.
